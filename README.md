# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This repository contains the code for a simple command-line implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game supports two players, with one player using the 'X' symbol and the other player using the '0' symbol.

## Getting Started
To play the game, simply run the player.py script in your terminal or command prompt. The script will prompt each player to enter their move in turn.

## Classes
The player.py script defines three classes:

## Player: The base class for all players. This class defines the get_move method, which is used to get the next move for a player.
RandomComputerPlayer: A subclass of Player that selects a random move from the available moves.
HumanPlayer: A subclass of Player that prompts the user to enter their move.
## Functions
The player.py script defines the following functions:

available_moves: A function that returns a list of available moves for a given game state.
winner: A function that determines the winner of a given game state.
## Usage
To use the player.py script, simply run it in your terminal or command prompt. The script will prompt each player to enter their move in turn.
